The term spatial statistics refers to the application of statistical concepts and methods to data that have a spatial location attached to them, and in which this locational element is used as an important and necessary part of the analysis. <br />

Its applications lie in exploring geographical determinants relevant for evaluating health intervention programmes or disaster management policies (eg, spatial inequalities within neighbourhoods such as poor road conditions that have an impact on child mortality or higher education outcomes). Another area of application could lie in exploring spatio-temporal dependencies to model climate data. Models that can be used include spatial autoregressive models, GLM, and Bayesian Hierarchical models.
